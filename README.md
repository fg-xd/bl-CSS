# bl CSS
A *lightweight*, **blueviolet**, ***small*** CSS framework!
# 0.7.1 - Release notes(by Dev)
Idk but I guess people *might've* got angry at me for not putting the ```@import url(link-to-font)``` in the **CSS** itself but now, It is finally in the CSS :D! Plus I fixed the linkbtn class :D!

Have a Nice day Using it **:D**
