FORMS IN BL-CSS :D
Now you can finally make your own form... with bl-css style :D
```.form``` for form tag, ```.label``` for label tag and ```.in``` for input with a pretty nice placeholder! Now your sites can have **forms**
# How to Change Accent Color?
To change from the **original** blueviolet theme you have to open the main```bl.css``` file and you can change the following:
```css
:root{
	--_: rgb(/* Your accent's RGB here */)
	--_4: rgba(/* Your RGB */, 0.4)
	--_6: rgba(/* Your RGB */, 0.6)
}
```
