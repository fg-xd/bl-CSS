# bl CSS
A *lightweight*, **blueviolet**, ***small*** CSS framework!
# 0.7.4 - Release notes(by Dev)
Guess what? I learned JS and Python in under **1 hour** and made a npx! use npx bl-css or npx bl to copy the file from the deep trenches of the alien(node_modules) to you DIRECT folder :D! And if you're feeling lucky, download bun and use bunx bl to do its **2x faster**

Have a Nice day Using it **:D**
