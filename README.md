# bl CSS
A *lightweight*, **blueviolet**, ***small*** CSS framework!
# 0.8.0 - Release notes(by Dev)
A long way of 4 patches and a new minor release! This release targets the 'custom color' aspect. I updated bl-css so that you can FINALLY, use your own custom colors... yeah you need to download it and change the original file, but its EASY!
# How to Change Accent Color?
To change from the **original** blueviolet theme you have to open the main```bl.css``` file and you can change the following:
```css
:root{
	--_: rgb(// Your accent's RGB here)
	--_4: rgba(// Your RGB, 0.4)
	--_6: rgba(// Your RGB, 0.6)
}
```

Have a Nice day Using it **:D**
